Most headaches will go away on their own and aren't a sign of something more serious.
How you can ease headaches yourself
Headaches can last between 30 minutes and several hours.



Do

drink plenty of water
get plenty of rest if you have a cold or the flu
try to relax - stress can make headaches worse
exercise when you can
take paracetamol or ibuprofen





Don't

drink alcohol
skip meals (even if you might not feel like eating anything)
sleep more than you usually would - it can make the headache worse
strain your eyes for a long time - for example, by looking at a screen






See a GP if:

your headache keeps coming back
painkillers don't help and your headache gets worse
you have a bad throbbing pain at the front or side of your head - this could be a migraine or, more rarely, a cluster headache
you feel sick, vomit and find light or noise painful
you get other symptoms - for example, your arms or legs feel numb or weak




What can cause headaches
The most common reasons are: 

having a cold or the flu
stress
drinking too much alcohol
bad posture
eyesight problems
not eating regular meals
not drinking enough fluids (dehydration) 
taking too many painkillers
women having their period or menopause



See a GP urgently if you have a severe headache and:

your jaw hurts when eating
blurred or double vision
your scalp feels sore

These could be signs that the arteries in your head and neck are inflamed. This needs urgent treatment.





Call 999 or go to A&E if:

you injured your head badly - for example, from a fall or accident
the headache came on suddenly and is extremely painful

You have an extremely painful headache and:

sudden problems speaking or remembering things
loss of vision
you're feeling drowsy or confused
you have a very high temperature, feel hot and shivery, and have a stiff neck or a rash
the white part of your eye is red

Most headaches will go away on their own and aren't a sign of something more serious.
How you can ease headaches yourself
Headaches can last between 30 minutes and several hours.



Do

drink plenty of water
get plenty of rest if you have a cold or the flu
try to relax - stress can make headaches worse
exercise when you can
take paracetamol or ibuprofen





Don't

drink alcohol
skip meals (even if you might not feel like eating anything)
sleep more than you usually would - it can make the headache worse
strain your eyes for a long time - for example, by looking at a screen






See a GP if:

your headache keeps coming back
painkillers don't help and your headache gets worse
you have a bad throbbing pain at the front or side of your head - this could be a migraine or, more rarely, a cluster headache
you feel sick, vomit and find light or noise painful
you get other symptoms - for example, your arms or legs feel numb or weak




What can cause headaches
The most common reasons are: 

having a cold or the flu
stress
drinking too much alcohol
bad posture
eyesight problems
not eating regular meals
not drinking enough fluids (dehydration) 
taking too many painkillers
women having their period or menopause



See a GP urgently if you have a severe headache and:

your jaw hurts when eating
blurred or double vision
your scalp feels sore

These could be signs that the arteries in your head and neck are inflamed. This needs urgent treatment.





Call 999 or go to A&E if:

you injured your head badly - for example, from a fall or accident
the headache came on suddenly and is extremely painful

You have an extremely painful headache and:

sudden problems speaking or remembering things
loss of vision
you're feeling drowsy or confused
you have a very high temperature, feel hot and shivery, and have a stiff neck or a rash
the white part of your eye is red

Most headaches will go away on their own and aren't a sign of something more serious.
How you can ease headaches yourself
Headaches can last between 30 minutes and several hours.



Do

drink plenty of water
get plenty of rest if you have a cold or the flu
try to relax - stress can make headaches worse
exercise when you can
take paracetamol or ibuprofen





Don't

drink alcohol
skip meals (even if you might not feel like eating anything)
sleep more than you usually would - it can make the headache worse
strain your eyes for a long time - for example, by looking at a screen






See a GP if:

your headache keeps coming back
painkillers don't help and your headache gets worse
you have a bad throbbing pain at the front or side of your head - this could be a migraine or, more rarely, a cluster headache
you feel sick, vomit and find light or noise painful
you get other symptoms - for example, your arms or legs feel numb or weak




What can cause headaches
The most common reasons are: 

having a cold or the flu
stress
drinking too much alcohol
bad posture
eyesight problems
not eating regular meals
not drinking enough fluids (dehydration) 
taking too many painkillers
women having their period or menopause



See a GP urgently if you have a severe headache and:

your jaw hurts when eating
blurred or double vision
your scalp feels sore

These could be signs that the arteries in your head and neck are inflamed. This needs urgent treatment.





Call 999 or go to A&E if:

you injured your head badly - for example, from a fall or accident
the headache came on suddenly and is extremely painful

You have an extremely painful headache and:

sudden problems speaking or remembering things
loss of vision
you're feeling drowsy or confused
you have a very high temperature, feel hot and shivery, and have a stiff neck or a rash
the white part of your eye is red

Most headaches will go away on their own and aren't a sign of something more serious.
How you can ease headaches yourself
Headaches can last between 30 minutes and several hours.



Do

drink plenty of water
get plenty of rest if you have a cold or the flu
try to relax - stress can make headaches worse
exercise when you can
take paracetamol or ibuprofen





Don't

drink alcohol
skip meals (even if you might not feel like eating anything)
sleep more than you usually would - it can make the headache worse
strain your eyes for a long time - for example, by looking at a screen






See a GP if:

your headache keeps coming back
painkillers don't help and your headache gets worse
you have a bad throbbing pain at the front or side of your head - this could be a migraine or, more rarely, a cluster headache
you feel sick, vomit and find light or noise painful
you get other symptoms - for example, your arms or legs feel numb or weak




What can cause headaches
The most common reasons are: 

having a cold or the flu
stress
drinking too much alcohol
bad posture
eyesight problems
not eating regular meals
not drinking enough fluids (dehydration) 
taking too many painkillers
women having their period or menopause



See a GP urgently if you have a severe headache and:

your jaw hurts when eating
blurred or double vision
your scalp feels sore

These could be signs that the arteries in your head and neck are inflamed. This needs urgent treatment.





Call 999 or go to A&E if:

you injured your head badly - for example, from a fall or accident
the headache came on suddenly and is extremely painful

You have an extremely painful headache and:

sudden problems speaking or remembering things
loss of vision
you're feeling drowsy or confused
you have a very high temperature, feel hot and shivery, and have a stiff neck or a rash
the white part of your eye is red

sleep more than you usually would - it can make the headache worse
strain your eyes for a long time - for example, by looking at a screen

You have an extremely painful headache and:

sudden problems speaking or remembering things
