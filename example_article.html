    <h1>Symptoms</h1>
    <p><strong>The main symptom of a migraine is usually an intense headache on one side of the head.</strong></p>
    <p>The pain is usually a moderate or severe throbbing sensation that gets worse when you move and prevents you from carrying out normal activities.</p>
    <p>In some cases, the pain can occur on both sides of your head and may affect your face or neck.</p>
    <h2 id="additional-symptoms">Additional symptoms</h2>
    <p>Other symptoms commonly associated with a migraine include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>nausea </li>
    <li>vomiting </li>
    <li>increased sensitivity to light and sound – which is why many people with a migraine want to rest in a quiet, dark room </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some people also occasionally experience other symptoms, including:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>sweating </li>
    <li>poor concentration, </li>
    <li>feeling very hot or very cold </li>

    <li><a href="/conditions/diarrhoea/Pages/Introduction.aspx">diarrhoea</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Not everyone with a migraine experiences these additional symptoms and some people may experience them without having a <a href="/Conditions/Headache/Pages/Introduction.aspx">headache</a>.</p>
    <p>The symptoms of a migraine usually last between four hours and three days, although you may feel very tired for up to a week afterwards.</p>
    <h2 id="symptoms-of-aura">Symptoms of aura</h2>
    <p>About one in three people with migraines have temporary warning symptoms, known as aura, before a migraine. These include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>visual problems – such as seeing flashing lights, zig-zag patterns or blind spots </li>
    <li>numbness or a tingling sensation like <a href="/conditions/pins-and-needles/pages/introduction.aspx">pins and needles</a>– which usually starts in one hand and moves up your arm before affecting your face, lips and tongue </li>
    <li>feeling dizzy or off balance </li>
    <li>difficulty speaking </li>
    <li>loss of consciousness – although this is unusual </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Aura symptoms typically develop over the course of about five minutes and last for up to an hour. Some people may experience aura followed by only a mild headache or no headache at all.</p>
    <h2 id="when-to-seek-medical-advice">When to seek medical advice</h2>
    <p>You should see your GP if you have frequent or severe migraine symptoms that can't be managed with occasional use of over-the-counter painkillers, such as <a href="/conditions/painkillers-paracetamol/pages/introduction.aspx">paracetamol</a>.</p>
    <p>However, be careful not to take too many painkillers as this could make it harder to treat headaches over time.</p>
    <p>You should also make an appointment to see your GP if you have frequent migraines (on more than five days a month), even if they can be controlled with medication, as you may benefit from preventative treatment.</p>
    <p>You should call 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone you're with experiences:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="/conditions/Paralysis/Pages/Introduction.aspx">paralysis</a> or weakness in one or both arms and/or one side of the face </li>
    <li>slurred or garbled speech </li>
    <li>a sudden agonising headache resulting in a blinding pain unlike anything experienced before </li>
    <li>headache along with a high temperature (fever), stiff neck, mental confusion, seizures, <a href="/conditions/Double-vision/Pages/Introduction.aspx">double vision</a>, and a rash </li>
    </ul>
    <p>These symptoms may be a sign of a more serious condition, such as a <a href="/conditions/Stroke/Pages/Introduction.aspx">stroke</a> or <a href="/Conditions/Meningitis/Pages/Introduction.aspx">meningitis</a>, and should be assessed by a doctor as soon as possible.</p>

    <h3>Stages of a migraine</h3>
    <p>Migraines often develop in distinct stages, although not everyone goes through all of these:</p>
    <p><strong>1. 'Prodromal' (pre-headache) stage</strong> –changes in mood, energy levels, behaviour and appetite that can occur several hours or days before an attack </p>
    <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Aura</strong> – usually visual problems, such as flashes of light or blind spots, which can last for five minutes to an hour </p>
    <p><strong>3. Headache stage</strong> – usually a pulsating or throbbing pain on one side of the head, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and/or extreme sensitivity to bright light and loud sounds, which can last for four to 72 hours </p>
    <p><strong>4. Resolution stage</strong> – when the headache and other symptoms gradually fade away, although you may feel tired for a few days afterwards</p>
